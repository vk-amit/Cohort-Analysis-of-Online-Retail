## Introduction
Cohort analysis is a powerful technique for understanding customer behavior, retention rates, and purchasing trends over time. This project uses a sample dataset to:
- Group customers by their first purchase month (cohort month).
- Analyze retention rates and visualize them with heatmaps.
- Examine average purchase quantities by cohort.

---

## Features
- Cohort segmentation by `CohortMonth`.
- Retention rate visualization using heatmaps.
- Pivot table generation for retention trends and average purchases.
- Data cleaning and transformation for accurate analysis.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`


## Results
- Retention Heatmap: Visualizes customer retention trends across cohorts.
- Actionable Insights: Identified key drop-off points and average purchase quantities.
